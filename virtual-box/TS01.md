PowerShell does not automatically execute programs in the current folder or path unless explicitly told to do so. 
There are two ways to fix it:

### ✅ Option 1: Use .\VBoxManage.exe instead of just VBoxManage
You're already in the correct folder (C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox), so run:

.\VBoxManage.exe modifyvm "UpWork" --defaultfrontend headless
That .\ tells PowerShell: “run this from the current directory.”

### ✅ Option 2: Add VBoxManage to your System PATH (permanently)
This lets you use VBoxManage from anywhere in PowerShell, CMD, or scripts.
Steps:
	1. Press Win + S, search Environment Variables, and open it.
	2. Under “System Variables”, find the Path variable and click Edit.
	3. Click New, then add this: C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
	4. Click OK through all dialogs.

  ✅ Open a new PowerShell window, and now you can run:
VBoxManage list vms
...from any location.
